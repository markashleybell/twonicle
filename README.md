Twonicle is a way to archive and search your tweets, independently of the Twitter web site. It came about because I wanted a way to be able to access and search my own tweets in a fast and simple manner, without relying on Twitter's somewhat unreliable interface and search facilities.

How to set up Twonicle on your own server
=========================================

1. Get the source: `git clone https://github.com/markashleybell/twonicle.git`
2. Copy the whole folder to your web server root (and rename it if you like)
3. Point your browser to `http://yourserver.com/twonicle/setup`
4. Fill in your details and submit
5. Follow the instructions to import your tweets

If for some reason you don't want to use the automated setup pages, you can manually create the file config.local.php and fill in your server details yourself: see config.local.php.example for the required variables.
